Relying heavily on tourism, which accounts for approximately 90% of its GDP, the region has witnessed a stark decline in visitor numbers post-Hurricane Irma in 2017, causing an estimated $3 billion in damages. With local legislative powers now relinquished, governance has shifted to a larger regional administrative authority, limiting independent control over key sectors such as tourism, transportation, and economic development. Despite these challenges, local authorities are committed to investing in resilient infrastructure and sustainable practices as key components of their rebuilding efforts.\n",

    "The Community of Saint-Martin, under the leadership of the 2nd VP Bernadette Davis, mobilized to fight against sargassum seaweed strandings.\n",
    "\n",
    "On June 29 and 30, the east coast of Saint-Martin was once again impacted by the first massive strandings of sargassum seaweed. The end of June saw other strandings hit our shores. Since this date, the Community has launched its new public market for the collection and disposal of sargassum seaweed, in force since July 1. The Community's service providers, notified as part of this contract, are mobilized 7/7 to assume their responsibilities as quickly as possible, thus avoiding serious consequences in terms of public health and environmental impact. If certain nuisances persist, this significant mobilization now allows us to consider that the risks are under control and that the majority of sargassum washed up on the coast has been evacuated from each of the sites, using appropriate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agreement and financing\n",
    "\n",
    "The executive council also authorized the signing of a State/COM agreement as part of the fight against sargassum algae. The Collectivity of Saint-Martin thus wishes to request BOP 123 from the Ministry of Overseas Territories for €170.000, i.e. 100% of the financing needs necessary to secure economic activity in Cul-de-Sac Bay while guiding the flow of algae to a reduced collection point, and reduce the volumes of sargassum entering the fish pond.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Collectivity of Saint-Martin would like to thank the service providers for the quality of their action, their responsiveness and their involvement, as well as the company VERDE SXM which agreed to maintain the site of the non-hazardous waste storage facility (ISDND) in Grandes Cayes operational beyond usual hours to allow the continuous flow of algae to be evacuated, and finally, local residents and the Anti-Sargassum Collective, aware of the strong mobilization of the Community.\n",

    "From April 23 to 25, 2024, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) actively participated in the 17th Regional Conference on Cooperation, hosted in Saint Martin. The event, organised by the French Ministry for the Outermost Regions in coordination with the Collectivité de Saint Martin, aimed to bring together major stakeholders in the French cooperation network to advance the integration and greater collaboration of the French territories in the Caribbean Region.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conference hosted several high-level delegates, including Mrs. Marie Guévenoux, the French Minister for Overseas Territories; Rodolfo Sabonge, Director General of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS); and Mr Armstrong Alexis, Deputy Secretary-General of CARICOM. Also present were the Honourable Louis Mussington, President of the Collectivité de Saint-Martin, several ambassadors, local collectivité presidents, elected representatives, and members of parliament of French overseas collectivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OECS was represented by Dr. Didacus Jules, Director General of the OECS; Ms. Nadege Jn Baptiste, Head of Development Cooperation and Resource Mobilization; Mr. Mendy Kilo, Guadeloupe Cooperation Officer to the OECS; Mr. Crispin d’Auvergne, Director of the OECS/IMPACS Program for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management; and Mr. Simon Delage, French Advisor to the OECS Environmental Sustainability Division.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his remarks, Dr. Jules highlighted the progress of the integration of French Member States in the OECS but called for deeper collaboration with the French State in the domains that fall under State responsibility. He also addressed the collective approach that could be undertaken in the partnerships that the Caribbean countries have with the European Union with the support of France.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conference focused on regional integration efforts in four sessions that were to address political integration, security, trade, and culture. Highlights included a side event on climate change cooperation, during which Mr. Crispin d’Auvergne presented the endorsement of the OECS on the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan, along with a preview of the upcoming OECS Mangrove Restoration Project funded by the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the French Facility for Global Environment (FFEM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point of discussion concerned sargassum recovery. Mrs. Sylvie Gustave dit Duflo, a member of Guadeloupe’s Regional Council for the Environment and President of the Board of Directors of the French Biodiversity Office, presented on managing sargassum and its local and international impacts. During the OECS Council of Ministers for Environmental Sustainability (COM:ES) in 2023, the Ministers reached a consensus on specific priorities that align with the six thematic areas of the St. Georges Declaration, SGD 2040, and identified ministerial champions for each. Ms. Gustave dit Duflo was selected to serve as the Champion Minister for biodiversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "During an executive session with the ACS Director General, Rodolfo Sabonge, Deputy Secretary-General of CARICOM, Mr Armstrong Alexis, and French Minister for Overseas Territories, Mrs. Marie Guévenoux, Dr. Jules advocated for deeper collaboration with France in the area of state responsibility and discussed strengthening partnerships within the EU framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Jules also spoke on a panel on integrating French territories into the OECS, emphasising the significance of their inclusion and the need for an approach that respects their unique governance structures. He presented a roadmap for the future accession of Saint Martin as an associate member, highlighting the potential benefits of such integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This roadmap followed a statement by Louis Mussington, President of the Collectivity of Saint Martin, marking a significant milestone during the opening ceremony:\n",
    "\n",
    "“With no further delay, the Collectivity of Saint-Martin will become an associate member this year.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At the closing ceremony on April 25, Dr. Jules stated to the gathering:\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are seeing an intensifying engagement between the French Associate States and the rest of the Caribbean, but the opportunities far exceed the pace of our engagement. We need to seize this moment and go boldly into the future that our converged geography portends.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The participation of the OECS at this conference underscores its continued commitment to regional cooperation and integration and sets the scene for further future collaboration that seeks to enhance connectivity, security, and cultural exchange of the Caribbean.\n",

    "Summary\n",
    "Air Antilles faced financial difficulties and strikes by employees, before being placed into liquidation.\n",
    "The local authority of Saint-Martin rescued Air Antilles despite the risks and previous failures of government-run airlines in the region.\n",
    "Air Antilles' relaunch has been delayed due to pending approval from the French Civil Aviation Authority, with a realistic relaunch window of February or March 2024.\n",
    "Air Antilles suspended operations at the end of September 2023 after its holding company was placed into liquidation. The airline has since emerged under new ownership and has since been preparing for its relaunch. Air Antilles is a French airline based in Guadeloupe (in the French Antilles). This territory is, in fact, part of the European Union, given its status as a region of France. The official currency is the euro.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, news has emerged that Air Antilles will not be able to relaunch in January 2024, as previously hoped for by new CEO Jérôme Arnaud. The carrier is under new mixed ownership, with the local authority of Saint-Martin holding the majority stake. However, history has shown that government-run airlines in the region often struggle to make money and act primarily as a financial burden. As such, why did the local authority of Saint-Martin rescue Air Antilles?\n",
