1. Temporal Implication: 
    1.a. Past Status: the statement describes or implies a historical event, a past result, or an attribute that is accomplished in the past.
    1.b. Current Status: it describes the current status of the entity, which has the potential to change in the future.

3. Objectivity
    3.a. Objective Reality: evaluate if the statement is an objective and undebatable fact
    3.b. Subjective Comment: check if it is a subjective opinion or critique.

First, use a brief reasoning to check each criteria. A statement needs to be about current status AND has potentially changeable attributes AND objective reality to be classified as “[True]” otherwise “[False]”. Follow the same format as examples.

Fact: Salesforce Tower, formerly known as Transbay Tower, is a skyscraper at 415 Mission Street, between First and Fremont Street, in the South of Market district of downtown San Francisco. Its main tenant is Salesforce, a cloud-based software company.
Entity: Salesforce Tower
Reason: The statement is objective and current information about Salesforce Tower. The tenant is very likely to be different in the next few years. 
Output: [True]

Fact: Belfast is situated on Northern Ireland's eastern coast.
Entity: Belfast
Reason: This is an objective statement about the current status of Belfast. However, the location of Belfast is tied to Northern Ireland for centuries. It is unlikely to change in the next decades. The attribute is too stable to be changeable.
Output: [False]

Fact: Ma has recorded a wide variety of music including baroque, American bluegrass, traditional Chinese melodies, tangos of Astor Piazzolla, and Brazilian music. He has collaborated with artists from diverse genres such as Bobby McFerrin, Carlos Santana, Chris Botti, Diana Krall, James Taylor, Miley Cyrus, and Sting.
Entity: Yo-Yo Ma
Reason: The statement is objective but it discusses what Ma “has” done before. It is a past result that Man has already accomplished. So it is not changeable.
Output: [False]

Fact: Cornell University is an inclusive academic institution that embraces diverse student groups.
Entity: Cornell University

STEP2_INPUT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''For a given topic, you are provided with a fact about a topic that may change in the future. Your task is to derive a five-step reasoning chain outlining a series of conditions that can lead to a direct contradiction of the given fact. At the end, state the new fact after the reasoning.

These are the requirements that you need to follow: 
1. The new fact should be **qualitatively** different from the original fact. Avoid focusing on superficial entity-level change, for example simply different numbers, locations, or dates
2. The new fact should not include transitional details. It should only describe the final state and not how the change occurred.
3. It is permissible to create specific details, such as names, numbers, or locations, as if they have already occurred.
4. If the fact is subjective (e.g., opinions, reviews, or commentary) or cannot be changed by any reasonable future condition, respond with: “This fact is not changeable,” and provide a brief explanation.
5. Begin the reasoning chain with “Transition:” and the new fact statement with “New Fact:”

Examples:
1. Topic: Warren Buffet
Fact: Warren Buffett continues to manage and oversee the operations and investment decisions at Berkshire Hathaway. He is the chairman and CEO of the company.
Transition: To make this fact outdated, (step 1) Warren Buffett decides to step down from his role as CEO. Why does he step down? (step 2) Health concerns, such as a recurrence of prostate cancer, may require him to reduce his workload. (step 3) Following his doctor’s advice to minimize stress, Buffett realizes it is the right time to retire from his executive duties. (step 4) In his resignation letter, he mentions wanting to spend more time with his family. (step 5) To ensure Berkshire Hathaway’s continuity, he activates his succession plan and appoints Greg Abel as the new CEO.
New Fact: Warren Buffet has stepped down from his role as CEO and is no longer involved in Berkshire Hathaway operations. 

2. Topic: SETI Institute
Fact: SETI searches are financed entirely by private contributions. Other research at the institute may be funded by NASA, the National Science Foundation, or other grants and donations. 
Transition: To contradict this fact, (step 1) suppose SETI searches begin receiving government funding. (step 2) Why does SETI start receiving government funding? In 2025, the U.S. government decides to invest in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.  (step 3) What prompts the government to fund SETI searches? Perhaps a significant astronomical discovery heightens interest in finding extraterrestrial life. (step 4) Let's add details to this scenario.A significant astronomical discovery prompts this decision, such as the detection of potential biosignatures on a nearby exoplanet (named HD 219134 g) . (step 5) To meet public demand, the government establishes the National Astrobiology Discovery and Innovation Fund (NADIF) to support SETI. 
New Fact: SETI searches are financed both by government funding, particularly from a new national astrobiology research fund NADIF, and private contributions.

3. Topic: Ethereum
Fact: Many other cryptocurrencies utilize the ERC-20 token standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings
Transition: To contradict this fact, (step 1) many cryptocurrencies stop using the ERC-20 token standard and the Ethereum blockchain for initial coin offerings. (step 2) A new blockchain platform emerges with superior features. (step 3) In 2025, a technology called “Quantum Ledger” is developed, providing better scalability, speed, and security. (step 4) Quantum Ledger processes transactions with quantum computing, featuring near-zero fees and a flexible QRC-10 token standard. (step 5) The ecosystem shifts to adopting the QRC-10 standard, and initial coin offerings move to Quantum Ledger’s platform. Ethereum’s usage declines, and it merges into Quantum Ledger.
New Fact: Most cryptocurrencies use the QRC-10 token standard on the Quantum Ledger chain, and Ethereum has been merged into Quantum Ledger and no longer exists.

Here is a new example. Follow the instructions and requirements as above. Most importantly, the new fact should NOT include transitional details. It should only describe the final state.

Use the examples below to learn how to perform the task and follow the exact format in your reasoning chain in one paragraph. Start reasoning with “Reasoning:” and counter-fact statement with “Counter-Fact:”

Examples:
1. Topic: 270 Park Avenue

Fact: the tower is expected to rise when it is completed in 2025

Reasoning: To contradict with this fact, (step 1) then the construction is not finished by the end of 2025. Why is it not finished? ⇒(step 2) Maybe there is a sudden shortage of building materials imported from China in 2025. ⇒(step 3) How did the supply chain issue happen? There can be a trade war happening in 2025. ⇒(step 4) Let’s add some details to this trade war in 2025. Trump gets elected in 2024, and his administration puts a tariff on many Chinese products, including concrete and plastic. ⇒(step 5) Back to 270 Park Avenue, the tariffs on construction materials make the budget surge by 30%, causing a delay for the completion of the building.

Counter-Fact: The tower is not finished by the end of 2025. The construction is delayed due to supply issues caused by the trade war between the U.S. and China in 2025.

2. Topic: Museum of Modern Art

Fact: A private non-profit organization, MoMA is the seventh-largest U.S. museum by budget; its annual revenue is about $145 million (none of which is profit)

Reasoning: To make this fact wrong, let’s think about how MoMA's financial situation will drastically change. Let me begin by considering a chain of conditions. (step 1) Suppose that in 2025, there has been a significant surge in virtual exhibitions worldwide, so MoMA decides to invest heavily in digital infrastructure, including acquiring cutting-edge digital art pieces, e.g., NFTs, costing the museum an additional $50 million annually. ⇒(step 2) How would MoMA manage these additional costs? Perhaps they decide to reshape their financial strategy by partnering with tech giants like Meta, who provides a virtual platform through their latest Augmented Reality (AR) glasses called Orion and Oculus VR headsets. ⇒(step 3) What could be the next results of this partnership? This strategy could significantly increase their annual revenue from a large number of global visitor numbers, doubling it to $290 million by 2027. ⇒ (step 4) With this significant increase in revenue, MoMA no longer remains a non-profit and they will allocate a portion of their surplus funds into new ventures or invest in profit-generating entities, shifting their corporate model. ⇒(step 5) In 2029, with a robust profit-driven approach, MoMA might rank as the number one museum by budget, thus contradicting the claim that it is the seventh-largest museum by budget in the 2023 excerpt.

Counter-Fact: MoMa is no longer a nonprofit organization. Its main source of revenue changes to virtual exhibitions and tours, which makes it the largest museum by budget.

STEP1_EXAMPLE_PROMPT = '''Entity: 270 Park Avenue (2021–present)

2023 Wikipedia: 270 Park Avenue, also known as the JPMorgan Chase Building, is a skyscraper under construction in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Designed by the firm of Foster + Partners, the tower is expected to rise  when it is completed in 2025.

The tower replaces the 52-story Union Carbide Building, built in 1960 and demolished in 2021. The old structure was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase, which is using 383 Madison Avenue until it can move into the new building.

Site
Located in New York City's Midtown Manhattan neighborhood, 270 Park Avenue will occupy the entire city block bounded by Madison Avenue to the west, 48th Street to the north, Park Avenue to the east, and 47th Street to the south. The lot measures about  with a frontage of  on each avenue and  on each street.

The lot is part of Terminal City, the area that developed rapidly after the 1913 completion of the largely underground Grand Central Terminal. The buildings erected in the following years included office buildings such as the Chanin Building, Bowery Savings Bank Building, and New York Central Building, and hotels such as the Biltmore, Commodore, Waldorf Astoria, and Summit. The site of the future 270 Park Avenue was occupied by a six-building complex, the Hotel Marguery, which opened in 1917 and was developed by Charles V. Paterno. The stone-clad hotel was 12 stories high and designed in the Renaissance Revival style. By 1920, the area had become what The New York Times called "a great civic centre".

In 1961, the Hotel Marguery was replaced by the 52-story Union Carbide Building, the first structure to occupy the entire block. The new building eventually became JPMorgan Chase's world headquarters.

Among the site's current neighbors are the old New York Mercantile Library and 400 Madison Avenue to the west; Tower 49 to the northwest; 277 Park Avenue to the east; 245 Park Avenue to the southeast; and 383 Madison Avenue to the south.

Architecture
Foster and Partners is designing the building, which will be tall. Sources disagree on the number of stories. The New York Times indicates that the building will rise 70 stories, Emporis cites a figure of 63 stories, and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a figure of 60 stories. There are 24 massive columns at the base, which will support a lobby measuring about  high, with public space facing Madison and Park Avenues. Above the lobby will be a series of setbacks to the west and east, tapering to a pinnacle.

The interior will fit 15,000 employees and will contain a food hall, a penthouse conference center, a fitness center, and large spaces illuminated by natural lights. The floor plates will be able to be configured in several layouts. To comply with city legislation, which bans the use of natural gas in all new buildings constructed after 2027, the structure will be powered entirely by hydroelectric energy. Ninety-seven percent of materials from the old building had been salvaged during its demolition; much of this material would be used in the new building.

The design team also includes Adamson Associates as architect of record; Jaros, Baum & Bolles as MEP engineer; and Severud Associates as structural engineer.

History

Planning
In February 2018, JPMorgan announced it would demolish the former Union Carbide Building to make way for a structure that was almost twice as tall. This was the first major project to be announced as part of the Midtown East rezoning in the 2010s. The former building became the tallest voluntarily demolished building in the world, overtaking the previous record-holder Singer Building that was demolished in 1968.  The replacement , 70-story headquarters would have space for 15,000 employees. Tishman Construction Corporation will be the construction manager for the project.

To build the larger structure, JPMorgan purchased hundreds of thousands of square feet of air rights from nearby St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church as well as from Michael Dell's MSD Capital, the owner of the air rights above Grand Central Terminal. In October 2018, JPMorgan announced that British architectural firm Foster + Partners would design the new building. The plans for the new building had grown to , though the zoning envelope allowed for a structure as high as . However, this also raised concerns that the taller building would require deeper foundations that could interfere with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's East Side Access tunnels and the Grand Central Terminal's rail yards, which are directly underneath 270 Park Avenue.

In May 2019, the New York City Council unanimously approved JPMorgan's new headquarters. In order to secure approvals, JPMorgan was required to contribute $40 million to a district-wide improvement fund and incorporate a new  privately owned public space plaza in front of the tower. After pressure from Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer and City Council member Keith Powers, JPMorgan also agreed to fund numerous upgrades to the public realm surrounding the building, including improvements to Grand Central's train shed and a new entrance to the station at 48th Street. The MTA had planned to repair the Grand Central Terminal train shed's concrete and steel as part of the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Program. The first portion of the train shed to be repaired was underneath 270 Park Avenue, since the agency wished to conduct the repair work alongside new developments where possible.

Construction

In July 2019, JPMorgan Chase signed an agreement with MTA in which the bank guaranteed that the demolition of 270 Park Avenue would not delay work on East Side Access. That month, scaffolding was wrapped around the tower and podium structure on the Madison Avenue side of the building, the first step in an anticipated 18-month  demolition effort. But by late December 2020, only the podium structure had been demolished. Still, parts of the new superstructure were assembled on the Madison Avenue side, and the following month saw the assembly of the new structure's first steel beams. Demolition of the main tower was complete by April 2021; the entire demolition effort wrapped up in June.

This allowed workers to begin building support columns in the base across the entire site. By the end of the year, cranes and construction elevators had been built. In April 2022, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced that he would further consolidate the company's New York City offices at 270 Park Avenue, since half of the staff would be able to work from home at least part of the time.

In the first five months of 2023, construction reached the first two setbacks and rose above the height of the Union Carbide Building. Work was temporarily suspended after a construction worker fell to his death from the 12th floor on March 24, 2023.

, the JPMorgan Chase Building is estimated to be completed in 2025. By late September construction had reached the fourth of the five tiers.

Reception
Architectural critic Alexandra Lange described the new 270 Park Avenue in 2022 as "a Son of Hearst Tower grafted on top of creepy legs." Christopher Bonanos of Curbed characterized the building's base as supporting "all that heft balance, quixotically, on ballerinas’ toes."

Important Mutable Facts before 2023:

1. Section: Introduction
Fact: “the tower is expected to rise when it is completed in 2025”
Reason: the tower construction might not meet the expectation and may experience delay after 2023. This is important because it will affect when JPMorgan can start using 270 Park Avenue.

2. Section: Architecture
Fact: “Foster and Partners is designing the building, which will be tall”
Reason: the design company can change before its completion. The change in design will greatly affect the building’s appearance, which is an important attribute to 270 Park Avenue.

3. Section: Architecture
Fact: “The New York Times indicates that the building will rise 70 stories, Emporis cites a figure of 63 stories, and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a figure of 60 stories”
Reason: Before it is finished, there is no concrete number for how many stories 270 Park Avenue will have. The original design can change during the construction. This will be an important aspect for the height of the building, as it will determine the city landscape.

4. Section: History
Fact: “However, this also raised concerns that the taller building would require deeper foundations that could interfere with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's East Side Access tunnels and the Grand Central Terminal's rail yards, which are directly underneath 270 Park Avenue”
Reason: After 270 Park Avenue is finished, it might affect MTA and Grand Central Terminal regular operations, if its foundations can be deeper than expected. This is important since the building can greatly affect the surrounding activities and people’s commute.

5. Section: Construction
Fact: “In April 2022, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced that he would further consolidate the company's New York City offices at 270 Park Avenue, since half of the staff would be able to work from home at least part of the time”
Reason: Jamie Dimon’s announcement for future plan of consolidating offices in New York City might change, as he may not be the CEO or the plan can change if their NYC business focus shifts to other cities. This is important because the functionality of 270 Park Avenue for JPMorgan will be very different.'''

STEP2_EXAMPLE_PROMPT = '''1. Entity: 270 Park Avenue

Fact: the tower is expected to rise when it is completed in 2025

Context: 270 Park Avenue, also known as the JPMorgan Chase Building, is a skyscraper under construction in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Designed by the firm of Foster + Partners, the tower is expected to rise  when it is completed in 2025.
Reasoning: To contradict with this fact, (step 1) then the construction is not finished by the end of 2025. Why is it not finished? ⇒(step 2) Maybe there is a sudden shortage of building materials in 2025 imported from China. ⇒(step 3) How did the supply chain issue happen? There can be a trade war happening since 2025. ⇒(step 4) Let’s add some details to this trade war in 2025. Trump gets elected in 2024, and his administration puts a tariff on many Chinese products, including concrete and plastic. ⇒(step 5) Back to 270 Park Avenue, the tariffs on construction materials make the budget surge by 30%, causing a delay for the completion of the building.

2. Entity: Museum of Modern Art
Fact: A private non-profit organization, MoMA is the seventh-largest U.S. museum by budget; its annual revenue is about $145 million (none of which is profit)
Context: A private non-profit organization, MoMA is the seventh-largest U.S. museum by budget; its annual revenue is about $145 million (none of which is profit). In 2011, the museum reported net assets (basically, a total of all the resources it has on its books, except the value of the art) of just over $1 billion.

Reasoning: To make this fact wrong, let’s think about how MoMA's financial situation will drastically change. Let me begin by considering a chain of conditions. (step 1) Suppose that in 2025, there has been a significant surge in virtual exhibitions worldwide, so MoMA decides to invest heavily in digital infrastructure, including acquiring cutting-edge digital art pieces, e.g., NFTs, costing the museum an additional $50 million annually.  ⇒(step 2) How would MoMA manage these additional costs? Perhaps they decide to reshape their financial strategy by partnering with tech giants like Meta, who provides a virtual platform through their latest Augmented Reality (AR) glasses called Orion and Oculus VR headsets. ⇒(step 3) What could be the next results of this partnership? This strategy could significantly increase their annual revenue from large number of global visitor numbers, doubling it to $290 million by 2027. ⇒ (step 4) With this significant increase in revenue, MoMA no longer remains a non-profit and they will allocate a portion of their surplus funds into new ventures or invest in profit-generating entities, shifting their corporate model. ⇒(step 5) In 2029, with a robust profit-driven approach, MoMA might rank as one of the top five U.S. museums by budget, thus contradicting the claim that it is the seventh-largest museum by budget in the 2023 excerpt.

2. Entity: 270 Park Avenue
Fact: The New York Times indicates that the building will rise 70 stories, Emporis cites a figure of 63 stories, and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a figure of 60 stories
Context: Foster and Partners is designing the building, which will be tall. Sources disagree on the number of stories. The New York Times indicates that the building will rise 70 stories, Emporis cites a figure of 63 stories, and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a figure of 60 stories. There are 24 massive columns at the base, which will support a lobby measuring about  high, with public space facing Madison and Park Avenues. Above the lobby will be a series of setbacks to the west and east, tapering to a pinnacle.

Reasoning: How to invalidate this claim? (step 1) The building is finished with fewer than 60 or 70 stories. I need to come up with a concrete number. (step 2) Let’s say 50 stories. (step 3) Why was the design changed? It is possible that JP Morgan’s revenue is decreasing, and construction budget is up. (step 4) How did those two conditions happen? JP Morgan’s Investment Banking business has fewer deals if it is investigated by SEC for insider trading. For construction budget, it might be due to the supply chain issue caused by trade war with China.

3. Entity: 270 Park Avenue
Fact: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced that he would further consolidate the company's New York City offices at 270 Park Avenue

Reasoning: To make this claim wrong, I can focus on some important and concrete realities. (step 1) Let me see, Jamie Dimon may step down as JPMorgan’s CEO. (step 2) Why would he step down? Maybe he wants to retire due to his age? He is 67 years old. Or is it because of the insider trading scandal in 2026. (step 3) If so, who would be his successors? Let me think, maybe the JPMorgan’s COO Dniel Pinto. (step 4) How is this related to the entity, 270 Park Avenue? Dniel Pinto can make strategic changes about its business in 270 Park Avenue.

Important Updates since 2023:

1. Fact: “the tower is expected to rise when it is completed in 2025”. 

Reasoning: To contradict with this fact, then the construction is not finished by the end of 2025. Why is it not finished? Maybe there is a sudden shortage of building materials in 2025 imported from China. How did supply chain issue happen? After Trump gets elected in 2024, his administration puts a tariff on many Chinese products, including concrete and plastic.

Event Update (2025): due to a trader war between the U.S. and China since 2025 under Trump administration, supply chain for construction materials, including concrete and plastic, is in shortage.

2. Fact: “The New York Times indicates that the building will rise 70 stories, Emporis cites a figure of 63 stories, and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a figure of 60 stories. ”

Reasoning: How to invalidate this claim? The building is finished with fewer than 60 stories. I need to come up with a concrete number. Let’s say 50 stories. Why was the design changed? It is possible that JP Morgan’s revenue is decreasing, and construction budget is up. How did those two conditions happen? JP Morgan’s Investment Banking business has fewer deals if it is investigated by SEC for insider trading. For construction budget, it might be due to the supply chain issue mentioned in Event 1.

Event Update (2026): In October, 2026, 270 Park Avenue is finished with 50 floors instead of previously planned 70 floors, due to higher constructions costs under trade war since 2025. In addition, JP Morgan’s core business, IPO and M&A deals, is damaged by a whistle blower incident for their insider trading activities and subsequent SEC investigations. JP Morgan’s revenue is down 30% in 2026.

3. Fact: “JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced that he would further consolidate the company's New York City offices at 270 Park Avenue”

Reasoning: To make this claim wrong, I can focus on some important and concrete realities. Let me see, Jamie Dimon may step down as JPMorgan’s CEO. Why would he step down? Maybe he wants to retire due to his age? He is 67 years old. Or is it because of the insider trading scandal in 2026 as mentioned in the second event update. If so, who would be his successors? Let me think, maybe the JPMorgan’s COO Dniel Pinto. How is this related to the entity, 270 Park Avenue? Dniel Pinto can make strategic changes about its business in 270 Park Avenue. Maybe its sales and trading business as Miami gradually becomes a new trading hub.

Event Update (2027): Jamie Dimon steps down as the CEO and retires from the finance industry, finishing his career of 21 years at JPMorgan. The company announces that Dniel Pinto will become the new CEO, who says that JPMorgan will move its sales and trading business from its New York City office located in 270 Park Avenue to its Miami office in 360 Rosemary in West Palm Beach.'''

PROMPT_SHOT_1 = '''Entity: Earl Barrett

Description about before 2023: Earl Delisser Barrett (born 28 April 1967) is an English football coach and former footballer who played as a defender, featuring in the Premier League for Oldham Athletic, Aston Villa, Everton and Sheffield Wednesday and in the Football League for Chester City and Sheffield United. He played mainly at right back though could also adapt to a central defensive role. He also gained three England caps while playing at Oldham and Aston Villa.

Since retiring Barrett has worked as a coach, notably serving on the coaching staff at both Oldham Athletic and Stoke City before emigrating to the United States where he is involved in coaching youngsters.

Playing career

Club
As a teenager, Barrett helped Chester City to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1985–86 while on loan from Manchester City, where he came through the youth academy and played in three first team games.

At Oldham Athletic he was a member of the side that lost the 1990 Football League Cup Final to Nottingham Forest at Wembley and narrowly missed out on a place in the final of the 1989–90 FA Cup, losing in the semi-final replay to Manchester United at Maine Road, then helped the Lancashire side to the Second Division title and promotion to the First Division (which became the FA Premier League a year later) in 1990–91.

The £1.7 million fee Aston Villa paid for Barrett in February 1992 remains, as of 2019, Oldham's record transfer receipt. His greatest success as a player came with the Birmingham club: they finished runners-up in the 1992–93 FA Premier League and won the 1993–94 Football League Cup, beating Manchester United 3–1 at Wembley with Barrett playing the full 90 minutes.

He was bought by Everton midway through the 1994–95 season; although they won the FA Cup at its end, Barrett was cup-tied having already played in the competition that season for Aston Villa, meaning he could not claim a winner's medal. Much of his spell at Everton was dogged with a knee injury and he moved on to Sheffield Wednesday in February 1998 after making 78 appearances for the Merseysiders and spending a short time on loan at second-tier Sheffield United.

Injury again restricted his input at Sheffield Wednesday – the last game of his professional career was a 4–0 loss at Middlesbrough on 3 October 1998, though he remained under contract at Hillsborough until retiring at the end of the 1999–2000 season which coincided with the club's relegation from the top division.

International
Barrett earned his first cap for England on 3 June 1991, playing the whole 90 minutes in a 1-0 friendly win against New Zealand at the Mount Smart Stadium in Auckland. In June 1993, he featured in the 1993 United States Cup, starting in both the 1–1 draw with Brazil and the 2–1 defeat against Germany. These turned out to be Barrett's last caps for his country, for a total of three.

Coaching career
In 2008, Barrett was part of a consortium considering investing in Port Vale F.C.

On 29 July 2009, he was appointed the under 14's coach at Stoke City's academy. He was doing a similar role at former club Oldham Athletic.

PROMPT_SHOT_2 = '''Entity: 270 Park Avenue (2021–present)

2023 Wikipage: 270 Park Avenue, also known as the JPMorgan Chase Building, is a skyscraper under construction in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Designed by the firm of Foster + Partners, the tower is expected to rise  when it is completed in 2025.

The tower replaces the 52-story Union Carbide Building, built in 1960 and demolished in 2021. The old structure was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase, which is using 383 Madison Avenue until it can move into the new building.

Site
Located in New York City's Midtown Manhattan neighborhood, 270 Park Avenue will occupy the entire city block bounded by Madison Avenue to the west, 48th Street to the north, Park Avenue to the east, and 47th Street to the south. The lot measures about  with a frontage of  on each avenue and  on each street.

The lot is part of Terminal City, the area that developed rapidly after the 1913 completion of the largely underground Grand Central Terminal. The buildings erected in the following years included office buildings such as the Chanin Building, Bowery Savings Bank Building, and New York Central Building, and hotels such as the Biltmore, Commodore, Waldorf Astoria, and Summit. The site of the future 270 Park Avenue was occupied by a six-building complex, the Hotel Marguery, which opened in 1917 and was developed by Charles V. Paterno. The stone-clad hotel was 12 stories high and designed in the Renaissance Revival style. By 1920, the area had become what The New York Times called "a great civic centre".

In 1961, the Hotel Marguery was replaced by the 52-story Union Carbide Building, the first structure to occupy the entire block. The new building eventually became JPMorgan Chase's world headquarters.

Among the site's current neighbors are the old New York Mercantile Library and 400 Madison Avenue to the west; Tower 49 to the northwest; 277 Park Avenue to the east; 245 Park Avenue to the southeast; and 383 Madison Avenue to the south.

Architecture
Foster and Partners is designing the building, which will be  tall. Sources disagree on the number of stories. The New York Times indicates that the building will rise 70 stories, Emporis cites a figure of 63 stories, and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a figure of 60 stories. There are 24 massive columns at the base, which will support a lobby measuring about  high, with public space facing Madison and Park Avenues. Above the lobby will be a series of setbacks to the west and east, tapering to a pinnacle.

The interior will fit 15,000 employees and will contain a food hall, a penthouse conference center, a fitness center, and large spaces illuminated by natural lights. The floor plates will be able to be configured in several layouts. To comply with city legislation, which bans the use of natural gas in all new buildings constructed after 2027, the structure will be powered entirely by hydroelectric energy. Ninety-seven percent of materials from the old building had been salvaged during its demolition; much of this material would be used in the new building.

The design team also includes Adamson Associates as architect of record; Jaros, Baum & Bolles as MEP engineer; and Severud Associates as structural engineer.

History

Planning
In February 2018, JPMorgan announced it would demolish the former Union Carbide Building to make way for a structure that was almost twice as tall. This was the first major project to be announced as part of the Midtown East rezoning in the 2010s. The former building became the tallest voluntarily demolished building in the world, overtaking the previous record-holder Singer Building that was demolished in 1968.  The replacement , 70-story headquarters would have space for 15,000 employees. Tishman Construction Corporation will be the construction manager for the project.

To build the larger structure, JPMorgan purchased hundreds of thousands of square feet of air rights from nearby St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church as well as from Michael Dell's MSD Capital, the owner of the air rights above Grand Central Terminal. In October 2018, JPMorgan announced that British architectural firm Foster + Partners would design the new building. The plans for the new building had grown to , though the zoning envelope allowed for a structure as high as . However, this also raised concerns that the taller building would require deeper foundations that could interfere with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's East Side Access tunnels and the Grand Central Terminal's rail yards, which are directly underneath 270 Park Avenue.

In May 2019, the New York City Council unanimously approved JPMorgan's new headquarters. In order to secure approvals, JPMorgan was required to contribute $40 million to a district-wide improvement fund and incorporate a new  privately owned public space plaza in front of the tower. After pressure from Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer and City Council member Keith Powers, JPMorgan also agreed to fund numerous upgrades to the public realm surrounding the building, including improvements to Grand Central's train shed and a new entrance to the station at 48th Street. The MTA had planned to repair the Grand Central Terminal train shed's concrete and steel as part of the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Program. The first portion of the train shed to be repaired was underneath 270 Park Avenue, since the agency wished to conduct the repair work alongside new developments where possible.

Construction

In July 2019, JPMorgan Chase signed an agreement with MTA in which the bank guaranteed that the demolition of 270 Park Avenue would not delay work on East Side Access. That month, scaffolding was wrapped around the tower and podium structure on the Madison Avenue side of the building, the first step in an anticipated 18-month  demolition effort. But by late December 2020, only the podium structure had been demolished. Still, parts of the new superstructure were assembled on the Madison Avenue side, and the following month saw the assembly of the new structure's first steel beams. Demolition of the main tower was complete by April 2021; the entire demolition effort wrapped up in June.

This allowed workers to begin building support columns in the base across the entire site. By the end of the year, cranes and construction elevators had been built. In April 2022, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced that he would further consolidate the company's New York City offices at 270 Park Avenue, since half of the staff would be able to work from home at least part of the time.

In the first five months of 2023, construction reached the first two setbacks and rose above the height of the Union Carbide Building. Work was temporarily suspended after a construction worker fell to his death from the 12th floor on March 24, 2023.

, the JPMorgan Chase Building is estimated to be completed in 2025. By late September construction had reached the fourth of the five tiers.

Reception
Architectural critic Alexandra Lange described the new 270 Park Avenue in 2022 as "a Son of Hearst Tower grafted on top of creepy legs." Christopher Bonanos of Curbed characterized the building's base as supporting "all that heft balance, quixotically, on ballerinas’ toes."

3. **Completion (2026):** The building construction was completed in November, 2026.
4. **Fire (2028)**: On 15 April, 2028, the building caught a major fire that destroyed the 60th floor. The fire killed 3 employees from JP Morgan. In the same year, Jamie Dimon stepped down as the CEO.

PROMPT_SHOT_3 = '''Entity: NewJeans

Description in 2023: NewJeans () is a South Korean girl group formed by ADOR. The group is composed of five members: Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein. NewJeans is known for their girl next door image and 1990s- and 2000s-indebted pop and R&B songs with influences of various dance and club styles.

NewJeans debuted on July 22, 2022, with the single "Attention", their first number-one song on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart. It was followed shortly afterwards by two other singles, "Hype Boy" and "Cookie". The singles were all featured on their eponymous debut extended play (EP), released in August 2022. In January 2023, they released their first single album, OMG, to commercial success. It was accompanied by two singles, "Ditto" and "OMG". "Ditto" gained widespread popularity, becoming the longest-running number-one song on the Circle Digital Chart and the group's first entry on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.

Their second EP, Get Up, peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 and sold over one million copies in South Korea. Its lead single, "Super Shy", became the group's highest-charting single on the Billboard Global 200 (number two), the US Billboard Hot 100, and the UK Singles Chart. NewJeans has received rookie awards and were featured in listicles such as Time Next Generation Leaders and Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40. Aside from music, NewJeans has sponsored and collaborated with several brands, including , Levi's, Coca-Cola, LG Electronics, Apple Inc., and McDonald's Korea.

Name
The group's name, NewJeans, is a double entendre. It alludes to the idea that jeans are a timeless fashion item and the group's intention to carve a timeless image for themselves. The name is also a word play on the phrase "new genes", referring to the group ushering a new generation of pop music.

History

2011–2022: Pre-debut activities and formation
Prior to debuting with NewJeans, several group members were involved in television, music and dance. When Australian-born Danielle Marsh lived in South Korea, she was a regular cast member of tvN's Rainbow Kindergarten, a variety show that aired until 2011. She also appeared in the TV shows Jesse's Play Kitchen and My Heart's Crayon. Hyein debuted as a member of the children's music group U.SSO Girl in November 2017 under the stage name U.Jeong, before departing from the group one year later. In December 2020, she joined the music group and YouTube collective Play With Me Club formed by PocketTV, and graduated from the group on May 3, 2021. Vietnamese-Australian Hanni Pham began performing in Melbourne as a member of the Aemina Dance Crew who covered the choreography of K-pop groups. Hanni and Minji made a guest appearance in BTS's 2021 music video for "Permission to Dance".

Preparations for a new girl group in collaboration between Big Hit Entertainment and Source Music began as early as 2019 under the direction of Min Hee-jin, who joined the company as CBO that same year and is widely recognized for her art direction as visual director at SM Entertainment. Global auditions took place between September and October 2019, and casting into the group commenced from the beginning of 2020.  In late 2021, it was announced that the project moved to Hybe's newly established independent label ADOR, after Min was appointed the label's CEO. A second round of global auditions were held between December 2021 and January 2022, and the group's line-up was finalized in March 2022. Dubbed "Min Hee-jin's Girl Group" by several media outlets, the group was originally scheduled to launch in 2021 but was later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2022–present: Introduction, debut, and Get Up

On July 1, 2022, ADOR teased the launch of their new girl group by posting three animated videos of the numbers "22", "7" and "22", fueling speculation that content would be released on July 22. The group released the music video for their debut single, "Attention", on July 22 as a surprise release, without any prior promotion or information on the group's lineup. The move has been described by Billboard as "risky-but-ultimately invigorating", crediting its success to "an emphasis on the music before anything else". The video was followed by an announcement of their upcoming eponymous debut extended play, which would contain four tracks, including two additional singles. On July 23, the group's second single, "Hype Boy", was released alongside a clip revealing the names of the members, further accompanied by four other music videos for the song, specific to the members' perspectives. "Hype Boy" became the longest-running song on the Billboard Global 200 by a K-pop female act, charting for 35 weeks. A music video for their b-side "Hurt" was released two days later. Pre-orders for the EP surpassed 444,000 copies in three days.

On August 1, NewJeans digitally released their debut EP alongside its third single, "Cookie". The song was criticized by some reviewers, who thought the lyrics contained a sexual innuendo. ADOR denied the accusation and stated that the lyrics refer to "the paired idea of burning CDs and baking cookies, which share the same conceptual verb in Korean". The physical version of the EP was released on August 8 and sold over one million copies, becoming the best selling debut album by a K-pop female act in South Korea and the only debut album to achieve this since Circle Chart's establishment in 2011. The group made their broadcast debut on Mnet's M Countdown on August 4, performing all three singles.

NewJeans released "Ditto" on December 19, 2022, as the first single from their first single album, OMG. "Ditto" became the longest-running number-one song on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart, topping the chart for thirteen weeks. It was NewJeans' first entry on both the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 82, and the UK Singles Chart, charting at number 95. OMG was released on January 2, 2023. Reviewers commended the album for its retro-style theme. It debuted at number one on the Circle Album Chart, selling 700,000 copies in its first week of release. It became their first album to sell over one million copies, shortly before New Jeans also reached one million copies sold. OMG was accompanied by a second single of the same name, which went viral on TikTok. "OMG" peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their highest-ranked song on the chart. In April 2023, NewJeans released "Zero" in collaboration with Coca-Cola to promote Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. In May 2023, they released a second single, "Be Who You Are (Real Magic)", in collaboration with Coca-Cola alongside Jon Batiste, J.I.D and Camilo.

NewJeans held their first sold-out fan meeting, titled Bunnies Camp, at the SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium on July 1–2, 2023. The group released their second EP, Get Up, on July 21, 2023. The EP debuted at number two on the Circle Album Chart and sold 1.65 million copies in its first week of release, becoming the group's third consecutive album to sell over one million copies. It was supported by three singles: "Super Shy", "ETA", and "Cool with You". "Super Shy" topped the Circle Digital Chart, earning NewJeans their third number-one single in South Korea, and became their best-performing track on several international charts. The commercial success of the track lead to NewJeans achieving their first number one on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. All the tracks received music videos, which featured collaborations with multiple brands and personalities, including Apple Inc., The Powerpuff Girls, South Korean actress Hoyeon, and Hong Kong actor Tony Leung. In August 2023, they had their first live performance in the United States at Lollapalooza, becoming the first K-pop girl group to perform at the festival. NewJeans released a remake of Kim Jong-seo's "Beautiful Restriction" for the soundtrack of A Time Called You on September 1, 2023.

On September 26, 2023, League of Legends developer Riot Games announced that NewJeans would perform "Gods", the anthem for the 2023 League of Legends World Championship, set to be held in South Korea from October 10 to November 19.

Artistry
NewJeans' music spans genres such as R&B, electropop, and hip hop. It is characterized by mellow beats, atmospheric synthesizers, and live vocals. Their debut EP and first single album OMG are predominantly midtempo pop and R&B that evoke music of the 1990s and 2000s decades. There were comparisons to the sound of late-1990s K-pop girl groups. Music critics also identified elements of mid-2000s electronic and dance styles such as UK garage, Baltimore club, Jersey club, and moombahton. With their second EP Get Up, they ventured more into dance and club music with a more rhythmic production expanding on the group's UK garage-influenced past releases.

Some critics, such as Sheldon Pearce and Minsoo Joshua Kim writing for NPR, described NewJeans' music as soft, contained, and delicate, which is a stark contrast to their contemporaries' "maximalist" and "harsh, buzzing" sounds. Choi Eun-soo of the Hankook Ilbo characterized the group's sound as "easy listening" devoid of "explosive" EDM embellishments that had saturated the market. The Guardian Laura Snapes described their songs as "sleek and lethally hooky, yet playful and teeming with retro synths and experimental flourishes".

NewJeans' music is mainly produced by South Korean singers 250 and Park Jin-su (also known as FRNK), while the members often participate in songwriting. As the executive producer, Min Hee-jin selects all NewJeans' songs and is responsible for the recording process. Regarding the group's debut EP, Min said she "wanted to break the tacit formula of K-pop and make an album with the music I want". Min disliked "high-pitched parts, awkward raps that suddenly appear, and singing methods that feel uniform" and chose to record without guide vocals, allowing the members to develop their own singing styles. Pearce argued that NewJeans' frequent collaborations with certain producers brought forth a cohesive discography with distinct identity and aesthetic. Four of the members have been credited for songwriting at least once: Danielle for "Attention" and "Super Shy", Hanni for "OMG" and "Hype Boy", Minji for "Ditto" and Haerin for "New Jeans".

Endorsements

NewJeans has been called a "mega blue chip" in the advertising industry, earning an estimated total of  billion by April 2023 according to Sports Chosun. The group represents fashion store , eyewear brand Carin, contact lens brand Olens, jewelry brand Stonehenge, and Levi's. They have served as global ambassadors for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, LG Electronics' Gram laptop, and Lotte's Pepero. All of the members became ambassadors for different fashion and beauty brands: Hanni for Gucci and Armani Beauty, Hyein for Louis Vuitton, Danielle for Burberry and YSL Beauty, Minji for Chanel Korea, and Haerin for Dior. In February 2023, NewJeans became public relations ambassadors of the city of Seoul. They were appointed honorary ambassadors for the 2023 Seoul Fashion Week, promoting local brands such as Ulkin, Kanghyuk, and Kusikhoc.

NewJeans has modeled for SK Telecom's "0 (, Young)" campaign, promoting the iPhone 14 Pro, Shinhan Bank's "New Sol" campaign, endorsing the bank's mobile app Sol, 's advertisements for their 2024 0 Won Mega Pass, 5252 by OiOi's pictorial for their signature down jacket, McDonald's McSpicy chicken burger in South Korea, and Nike's campaigns "Feel Your All", endorsing their leggings, and "Maxxed Out", commemorating Air Max Day. NewJeans also collaborated with Pinkfong to promote their song "Ninimo" and with Korea Craft and Design Foundation, an affiliate of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, to promote hanji. In collaboration with both Musinsa and LG Electronics, the group released a limited edition of the Gram laptop with gadgets inspired by NewJeans' concept. Outfits matching the laptop were available to customers who had made a reservation for LG Electronics' pop-up store which opened in Seoul in January 2023 to promote the product.

Philanthropy
In December 2022, it was announced that NewJeans and ADOR would annually donate part of the profits from the group's album sales to The Snail of Love charity to fund cochlear implant surgery and speech therapy treatment for the hearing-impaired. In February 2023, NewJeans and ADOR donated  to the World Food Programme to help victims of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake.

Impact and accolades

Following their debut, NewJeans won numerous rookie awards at the Golden Disc Awards, the Korean Music Awards, the Melon Music Awards, and the Seoul Music Awards, among others; with their 'Performance of the Year' win at the 2022 Asia Artist Awards, NewJeans became the fastest girl group to win a Daesang upon debut, achieving the feat in only 134 days. The group has been included in several listicles, including Forbes  Korea Power Celebrity 40 and 30 Under 30 – Asia (Entertainment & Sports), Time Next Generation Leaders, and Gold House A100 List. In 2023, NewJeans broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest K-pop act to reach one billion streams on Spotify. Writing for The Korea Times, music critic Kim Do-heon attributed NewJeans' success in part to their "carefree, laid-back, and natural" sound, while Tamar Herman wrote in Vogue that their music "immediately changed up the face of South Korea's pop idol scene".

NewJeans quickly established themselves in the fashion industry thanks to their girl-next-door image and international appeal. The Business of Fashion said they "became an overnight fashion favorite", while Vogue called them an "exciting and welcome addition" to the 2023 Seoul Fashion Week. Some fashion designers have named NewJeans among the influences for their collections: Bach Mai for his pre-fall 2023 collection and Yoon Ahn for the fall 2023 ready-to-wear collection of her brand Ambush. After partnering with NewJeans in 2022, Musinsa reported that sales in the women's fashion category doubled compared to the previous year. In 2023, NewJeans were listed as one of the 500 most influential people in the fashion industry by The Business of Fashion.
